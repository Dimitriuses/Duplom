### First
This is my first game on Unity and diploma project for ITStep.<br />
When I created this project I was inspired by the program Cisco Packet Tracer.<br />
So here's what i was able to do:<br />
#### What's in this project:
There are computers in this project<br>
<img alt="" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/Screenshot_129.png" /><br>
And you can turn on/off it.<br>

<img alt="" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/PC.gif" /><br>
Next thing i my project is<Br>
a Router:<br>
<img alt="" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/Screenshot_131.png" /><br>
And it is WORK<br>
<img alt="" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/Screenshot_132.png" />
<img alt="" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/Router.gif" /><br>
You can place computers and routers on a schematic grid<br>
<img alt="" width="1000px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/Place.gif" /><br>
This project has only 2 schematic objects but the code provides for the addition of any number of such objects, but only in the code.<br>
Next thing is a Tools:<br>
<img alt="" width="1000px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/image027.png" /><br>
Tools are on the right side. Here it is the same as with schematic objects. Has 2 tools but more are provided.<br>
So we have 2 tools "LAN" and "Electric" wires. Other tools do not have to be "wire".<br>
Since I didn't add electricity then I implemented only "LAN Wire"<br>
<img alt="" width="1000px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimitriuses/Duplom/master/Screenshots/Wire.gif" /><br>
And yes, these lines have their own functionality. In the code, each schematic object has an IP address, and this line can connect objects. These objects can now get the IP address of the object that is connected to it. Functionality can be extended.<br>
In this project you can craft pc:<br>

You have 4 types mothercards (in right side), and You have more detals:<br>
